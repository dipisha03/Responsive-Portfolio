	<p id="p"> Hi everyone! I'm dipisha, aka dips. I was born on 9/3 so I'm a virgo. I was born and raised in Northeast India before my family relocated to NJ in 2003. After graduating Rutgers in 2014 with a Bachelors in HR I moved to Harlem, NY in 2015 where I really got the feel of cultural NY! My apt in Harlem was right by central park which was also a great perk. I lived in Harlem for about a year and half prior to moving to Bedstuy, Brooklyn which was also very cultural. As for work, I've mostly worked in the Talent Acquisition space at various companies such as ADP, JP Morgan, and Capital One. Currently I'm at Amex working in Global Talent Acquisition supporting Tech. Working for a fin-tech sparked my interest in Tech so I'm hoping to make a career transition after finishing up this Bootcamp!</p>

	<p id="p"> Aside from work, I'm a fitness ethusiast so I decided to get my Spinning Certification in June to share my love for spinning with others :) Currently I teach at Eclipse Fitness in Greenbrook on Route 22 so come ride with me! You'll find me there every tuesdays at 7pm and I promise you'll leave feeling great!! Besides spinning my interests include rock climbing, bouldering, hiking, cooking, music, reading, traveling, trying new food and I <strong>LOVE</strong> meeting new people. If you want to learn more about me feel free to check out my portfolio and contact me! :) </p>
